		<h1>About Studio 7</h1>
		<p>
        Funnily enough, our name came to be as a result of not wanting to chose a name,<br>
        so we just used the number of people of our group.
        <br><br>
        Let us seven introduce ourselves:

                <p>
                I was responsible for the level design, the website and some technicals like the save file system and the statistics.
                I am also passionate gamer who was really enthusiastic about creating this game (even through it wasn't really my genre).

                <p>
                I implemented our central mechanics - the different lights and their attraction, as well as most of the movement.
                Additionally I've created the main menu of the game and written and designed for the website.<br>
                I love the journey game development took us on together and all the things we learned along the way.

                <p class="designation">Technical</p>
                <p>
                As a member of the project team, I played a key role in developing the controls and user interface for the application.
                In addition, I was responsible for implementing animations and the logic behind many game elements, 
                working in close collaboration with our design team to integrate the graphics into our game.

                <p class="designation">Technical and 3D Animation</p>
                <p>
                As I have a background in 3D modeling, I was responsible for the 3D Animations at the start and end of the game and trailer.
                I also had my fingers in the early checkpoint system, primitive level design and implemented all the enemies.<br>
                I had a lot of fun with this incredible team and hope to work with them together again in the future.
                <br><br>
                <q>Is it actually possible to create a game about a moth? Yeah it is!</q>

                <p class="designation">2D Animation and Design</p>
                <p>
                As a part of the design team, I was in charge for the animations and part of the assets.
                Considering that I had never animated before, the animations were a significant challenge.
                Trying to get all character movements right was no easy task, but in the end it all worked out.
                <br><br>
                <q>I'm not as creative as I may seem. I don't even know what to put here</q>
                </p> 
            </div>

                <h3 class="designation"><b>Regine Lendway</b></h3>
                <p class="designation">2D Animation and Design</p>
                <p>
                For me the most important part about the designs was to create a visually captivating 
                and immersive artwork that would convey the spirit and essence of the game.
                Through my illustrations, I aimed to bring the mystical world of the moth to life.<br>
                However, this is not limited to the in game assets but also to the color schemes of the user interface 
                to carry the mood throughout the whole game experience.

                <p>
                While I'm currently pursuing studies in media informatics, my greatest passion lies in creating music. I've been composing for over a decade now, but the soundtrack I produced for MothTale holds a special place in my heart. It was the first time I ventured away from my classical roots and experimented with some incredible synthesizers.
