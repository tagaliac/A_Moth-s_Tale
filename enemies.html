		<h1>Lights</h1>
		<p>
			Moths are <b>attracted</b> by light.<br>
			You can't prevent yourself from flying into the alluring glow, even if it's dangerous for you!
			<br><br>
			There are 3 different types of lights to watch out for:

				<td style="width:33%">
					<h4>Yellow Light: Such a cozy glow! &#128161</h4>
					Street or miners lanterns are nothing but necessary for your journey.
					Use these to refill your light meter before you die.<br>
					A moth scared of the dark, who would have thought?
					<br><br>
					Find the next one as quickly as possible, as there is only very limited amount of time available.
					Additionally, use the attraction for height boosts to get to places your wing flaps are not sufficient.
					<br><br>
					<u>Damage:</u> None<br>
					<u>Helpfulness:</u> Essential to regenerate light
				</td><!-- yellow light text-->
				<td style="width:33%">
					<h4>Red Light: Ouch, it burns! &#128293</h4>
					Fires or lanterns with an open flame emit a warm, red light.
					But don't let yourself be deceived - if you only as much as <i>touch</i> the outermost edge, the moth goes up in flames!
					<br><br>
					Leave the fire to cool down and stop burning, 
					or use it to your advantage to burn nasty <a href=#Blockages><b>spiderwebs</b></a> in the way of your progression.
					<br><br>
					<u>Damage:</u> 8HP every X second<br>
					<u>Helpfulness:</u> Clearing spiderwebs
				</td><!-- red light text-->
				<td style="width:33%">
					<h3>Blue Light: Beware of high voltage! &#9889</h3>
					An electrical lantern is usually used by humans to get rid of little pests, among which they consider moths too.
					This is how all your friends died that night.
					<br><br>
					Resist the attraction to the light, as it will <i>kill</i> you if you get too close.
					Listen out for their characteristic electrical buzzing.<br>
					Unfortunately you'll still need them sometimes to catapult yourself to a new location, proceed with caution!
					<br><br>
					<u>Damage:</u> Kill on touch<br>
					<u>Helpfulness:</u> Low, but sometimes unavoidable to proceed

		<h1>Enemies</h1>
		<p>
		You are bound to meet other insects and creepy-crawlies along your journey.</br>
		None of them are friendly though.

					<h3>Horn beetle</h3>
					This fellow resides deep in the dark caverns, relentlessly crawling from side-to-side 
					and easily getting upset by unknown visitors.  
					If angry, it will home in directly towards you and throw you back with its strong horn.<br>
					Doing massive damage and protected by its hard shell, it can easily become a major danger.
				</td>
				<td style="width:50%">
					<h3>The Flyght</h3>
					The menacing combination of a flying ant and an electrical light.
					<br>
                    Seeing the blue glow you may find yourself attracted to it
                    and victim to the main method of hunting by the flyght.
                    Just keep your distance, as the flyght will only fly its own path.

		<p>
		Aside from the previously described, common obstacles may also block your way.<br>
        Finding a way to circumvent them is your task.

                    <h3>Spiderwebs</h3>
					Luckily there are no spiders nearby, but these fine structures<br>
                    are still interfering with your journey
                    as they prevent you from further progressing.<br>
                    Use fire (red lights) to your advantage to burn them.

					<h3>Spikes</h3>
                    Honestly, not much too say about this one.<br>
                    Just don't fall into them...<br>
                    From plains, grassy wetlands or caves, these plants grow everywhere, so watch out!
